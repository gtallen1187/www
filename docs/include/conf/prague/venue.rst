Our venue for the conference and writing day is `Hotel Olšanka`_ , located on Táboritská 1000/23, Prague 3 (Žižkov district). After sadly saying goodbye to Auto Klub, we're excited to provide a bigger space for all our documentarian friends!

The neighborhood has everything you need to be comfortable during your stay, as well as convenient transportation links to the city center.
